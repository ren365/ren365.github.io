I'm Zehao Wang. I received my master’s degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Carnegie Mellon University and my bachelor’s degree in Information Science (actually it is telecommunication science) from Zhejiang University, China.

I have broad research interest among machine learning, autonomous driving, Internet of Things and beyond-CMOS computing. 

My past research interest (in my bachelor) falls in metamaterial. It is a hot interdisciplinary among electromagnetic, applied physics and material science, contributing to thousands of papers a year. The main idea is to use nanostructure (in the most of time, the "nanostructure" seems big in human eye but smaller than the length electromagnetic wave) to go beyond conventional materials. To learn more about metamaterial, check wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamaterial) or [my work](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.27.030332).
